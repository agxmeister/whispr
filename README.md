## Whispr

Whisper is the universal MCP server that allows your AI client of choice access to virtually any service that exposes the REST API according to the OpenAPI specification.

We call the services attached to Whisper "edges," highlighting that you enrich your AI with new capabilities - adding new edges.

To attach your service of choice, you need only provide its OpenAPI specification and basic description, which will give the AI an idea of what purpose your service might help.

You can refer to the /edges directory to get the idea of how the configuration might look.

Whisper is designed to work locally on your laptop or desktop computer, so you can feel safe providing access tokens for attached services.

### How to use

To use Whisper, you must have Node.js v20 or later installed on your computer, unless you plan to install Whisper as a DXT extension of your Claude Desktop.

Node.js will also be needed to generate configuration files (see below).

#### How to build

To build Whisper (dist/index.js):

`npm run build`

To build Whisper as a Claude Desktop Extension (whispr.dxt):

`npx ts-node scripts/build-dxt-manifest.ts`
`npx @anthropic-ai/dxt pack`

#### How to configure

Generate the Whisper configuration file:

`npx ts-node scripts/build-configuration.ts`

Generate the configuration to attach Whisper as an MCP server to your AI of choice:

`npx ts-node scripts/build-mcp-configuration.ts`

The output will look like this:

```json
{
    "type": "stdio",
    "command": "node",
    "args": [
        "/path/to/whispr/dist/index.js",
        "--config",
        "/path/to/whispr/config.json"
    ],
    "env": {
        "EDGE_MIRO_API_KEY": ""
    }
}
```

Add these lines to the MCP client configuration file and fill in the environment variables.
